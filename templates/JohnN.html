 <h2> Unit One Highlight </h2>
 

 <div>
  <p> This is John Nelson page, and one highlight from Unit one in CSE was making our own app.

  <p> The first highlight of this class is from Unit one in CSE making our own app.

    I made a wack a mole like game where you had to tap on a moving sprite to get points and reach the next level. I 
    really enjoyed making this game because of how much freedom we had, and this was my first time were I felt like I knew 
    what I was coding and had a goal in mind, rather then just following directions.</p>

 <h3> Unit Two Highlight </h3>
 

 <p> The second unit we did was the SDV's. This unit was probably my least favorite simply becasue of how inconsistent the SDV's
  vision sensor was. Even the smallest change of light would completely throw off the vision seonsor, forcing you to reset it which 
  would take at least 5 minutes. However, I really enjoyed the satisfaction of finaly getting it to work especially in the final part
  of the unit which was making a convoy of the SDV's. Although I did not enjoy developing this project, in my oppion this was the coolest
  part of this class.</p>
